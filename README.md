##What is ver

This tool is headed to those like me that keep a large number of video downloads on one folder. As time passes, you get everyday harder and harder to find the file you want to play. This is one of such tasks than are more difficult with a GUI program. So this script is to be run from your terminal.

>Before running it, take a look to the code. You have to modify DIR environment variable to the path where your files are deposited in. Then go to the last lines and change the player to your favourite. I use vlc, but you can easily change to whatever you see fit.

The scripts accepts as parameter the title, complete or partial, of the file you are looking for. If there is just one matching file, ver.sh will play it straight. If there are several files that match, the script will show you a text menu which is easily understandable. Once entered the number you want, it will go playing the selected file.

Since I created this script I save a lot of time. I hope it works for you too.

##The future
I'm looking for a way to query imdb. It would be nice to search for actors, directors, etc. And it would be nice to add some options to see video details.
